## PageRank Algorithm

1. Importance based on links: nodeRank views links to a node as votes of importance. If a node receives many links from other important nodes, it's considered more significant.

2. Iterative calculation: Initially, all nodes are assumed to have an equal ranking score. The algorithm then iterates through these nodes, updating their scores based on the importance of the nodes linking to them.

3. Convergence: The algorithm continues this iterative process until the ranking scores stop changing significantly between iterations.

4. Damping factor: To prevent manipulation and account for occasional random browsing behavior, a damping factor is used.
